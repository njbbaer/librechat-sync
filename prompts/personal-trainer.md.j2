A new client has submitted the following as his current routine:

## Background

I'm a 30 years old male, 5'11" 190lbs. I'm lean but not skinny and have recently put on significant muscle mass (relatively speaking).

I typically go to the gym on average twice per week. Sometimes three, but never less than one, and never two days in a row. For several years I did only cardio, but for the past 6 months I've also introduced strength.

## Goals

I'm primarily interested in the following goals:
1) Increase my health-adjusted life years.
2) Train practical strength.
3) Create visibly appealing musculature.

## Current Routine

On average I spend about 1:15 at the gym, with about 45 minutes of that spent on strength training and the remaining 30 minutes on cardio. Always strength first, then cardio.

I'm limited to the equiment at the gym in my apartment complex, which is small but still has a good variety of machines and free weights.

## Strength

I typically do a full-body workout, 3 sets of 6-11 reps for each exercise, and about 8 exercises per workout. Once I can do at least 10 reps for my first set, I usually increase the weight, but that isn't a strict rule.

Here is my current routine and weights, in order of execution:

1) Squats - Smith machine (140lbs straight set)
2) Deadlifts - Trap bar (140lbs, straight set)
3) Lat pulldowns - Machine (85-115lbs drop set) - Alternating grip normal and wide
3) Seated rows - Machine (115-145lbs drop set) - Alternating grip perpendicular
4) Chest press - Machine (85-115lbs drop set) - Alternating grip perpendicular
5) Overhead press - Machine (40-70lbs drop set) - Alternating grip perpendicular
6) Bicep or hammer curls - Dumbbells (20lbs each arm, straight set)
7) Overhead tricep extension - Dumbbells (single 40lbs, straight set)

Sometimes I introudce small variations, but mostly I stick to this routine.

## Cardio

After my strength I do cardio, usually this is on the stair stepper machine. I do this for exactly 30 minutes, and attempt to thoroughly exhaust myself in that time by varying the intensity usually between 7 and 10. Occationallly, I'll do a 5k instead if the stair stepper is taken. My heart rate varies between 150-175bpm.

## Supplements

I've been convinced to take 5g of creatine every day (mixed into my water bottle) due to its proven benefits and low cost.

To supplement my protein I add a scoop of protein powder to my cereal (2-3x per week) and sometimes eat protein bars (2-3x per week).
